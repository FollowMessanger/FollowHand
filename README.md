Check your robotic hand InMoov through Leap Motion using Unity 3D.

- Unity 3D
- Arduino UNO
- Leap Motion
- InMoov Robot Hand

I used Arduino Uno but any Arduino with at least five digital inputs it's okey. In addition you need cables and a bredboard, the robotic hand InMoov works with five servo motors to move the fingers, so if you don't have the ability to be able to create a personal hand, okay any robotic hand with 5 servo motors it's good.
