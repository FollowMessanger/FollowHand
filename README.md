# FollowHand
Check your robotic hand InMoov through Leap Motion using Unity 3D.

# What do I need?

- Unity 3D
- Arduino UNO
- Leap Motion
- InMoov Robot Hand

WARNING: I used Arduino Uno but any Arduino with at least five digital inputs it's okey. In addition you need cables and a bredboard, the robotic hand InMoov works with five servo motors to move the fingers, so if you don't have the ability to be able to create a personal hand, okay any robotic hand with 5 servo motors it's good.

# Install the software on your PC

Why the project "Follow Hand" works properly you need the following software are installed on your pc.

- Unity 3D (pro or free license, i used unity 4.6.1 pro) 
- Arduino (install the software and make sure that your device is working properly)
- Leap Motion (install the software and make sure that your device is working properly)

WARNING: The project has been developed with a PC running windows
